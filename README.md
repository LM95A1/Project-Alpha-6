# Project Alpha Six

*Project One Repository for Group Six, designated codename Alpha Six.*

Welcome to our Champion Analysis Project, authored by the members of Group Six. This project is a statistical analysis using the methods learned in our lessons thus far to articulate the best potential team for the Pokemon League Challenge, a scenario where no Legendary or Mythical Pokemon are allowed and only Pokemon from Generation 1 through 8 are available to you.

This Jupyter Notebook was drafted in Visual Studio Code with all members of Group Six taking part in different prototypes contained in the Prototypes directory. Though GitHub does offer version control and separate branches, this was a personal method of keeping different versions in one place where I could display them all at once and work from there. The final version of the Jupyter Notebook is the one you see here, and the final version of the PowerPoint is the one you see in the main directory. In this README, you can find a report on what we discovered through our analysis and how we came to our conclusions.

# Pokémon League Championship

## 1. Introduction

In the world of Pokémon, trainers aim to catch, train, and battle a wide variety of creatures known as Pokémon, creating teams of several different varieties to their liking. These Pokémon can be categorised into different types, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. This report provides a statistical overview of how these strengths and weaknesses throughout Pokemon types and sizes can be used to build a successful Championship team.

With the PokeAPI, we were able to gather data on all Pokémon species, including their types and stats. We then used this data to create visualizations and conduct statistical analyses to determine the best Pokémon types and sizes for a Championship team.

## 2. Distribution of Pokémon Types

When looking at the overall distribution of Pokémon types, Water, Normal, and Grass emerge as the most common types amongst all Pokémon species. Conversely, the types that are least represented amongst Pokémon are Ice, Ghost, with Steel and Fairy being equally rare. This disparity in type distribution may influence the strategies trainers use when building their teams.

## 3. Analysis of Pokémon Stats by Type

### 3.1 Attack Stats

Interestingly, the Fighting type boasts the highest average attack stat amongst all types. However, the highest individual attack stat belongs to a Pokémon of the Grass/Steel type.

### 3.2 Special Attack Stats

Psychic types have the highest average Special Attack stat, an important consideration for trainers looking for Pokémon with powerful special moves. However, the Pokémon with the single highest Special Attack stat is an Electric type.

### 3.3 Defense Stats

When considering Defense stats, Steel type Pokémon tend to be the most formidable on average. Despite this, the Pokémon with the highest individual Defense stat is a Bug/Rock type.

### 3.4 Special Defense Stats

Similarly to Defense, Psychic type Pokémon have the highest average Special Defense stat. However, the Bug/Rock type Pokémon holds the highest individual Special Defense stat.

### 3.5 Speed Stats

In terms of Speed, Electric types hold the top spot for the highest average stat, though the fastest individual Pokémon is a Bug/Flying type.

### 3.6 HP Stats

Finally, Dragon type Pokémon exhibit the highest average HP stat. Nevertheless, the Pokémon with the highest individual HP stat is a Normal type.

## 4. Size Stats and Considerations for Team Building

Despite Slaking having the highest total stats, it has an ability, Truant, which makes it skip every other turn. This can be a considerable disadvantage in battles, making it a potentially less favorable choice for a team. Along with this ability, its stats were distributed in a way that left it wide open to opposing attacks, further influencing against including it on a championship team. On the other hand, Dragon type Pokémon are commonly found amongst the customizable team of six with the highest total stats, showcasing their incredible overall power.

Interestingly, size and weight do not seem to be decisive factors for a Pokémon's overall stat performance. Neither the heaviest nor the tallest Pokémon are amongst the top six in any stat category. On the other hand, one of the lightest Pokémon, Kartana, holds the top spot for Attack stats.

## 5. The Ideal Pokémon Championship Team

For trainers aiming to participate in the Pokémon Championships, a rigorous test of strength and endurance, we found that a combination of Pokémon from the 600 Base Stat Club would make for a formidable team. This club includes Dragonite, Tyranitar, Salamence, Metagross, Garchomp, Hydreigon, Goodra, Kommo-o, and Dragapult.

## 6. Conclusion

Understanding the statistical distributions and unique characteristics of different Pokémon types is a vital part of successful training and battling. Trainers should consider not just type but also a Pokémon's individual stats and abilities when assembling their teams.
